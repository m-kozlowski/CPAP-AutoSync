# ESP32 CPAP AutoSync - User Guide

This package contains precompiled firmware for automatically uploading CPAP data from your SD card to a network share or the Cloud (**SleepHQ**).

Built with **extreme ease of use** in mind:
- 📱 **Setup Wizard**: No need to edit text files. Connect to the device's WiFi and follow a visual, step-by-step setup on your phone.
- 🧠 **Auto-Detects Hardware**: Automatically detects if your CPAP supports Smart Mode (AirSense 11) or falls back safely (AirSense 10).
- ✅ **Foolproof Configuration**: The wizard validates your upload schedule to prevent impossible configurations and SD card errors.
- 🌐 **VPN & Network Friendly**: The setup process seamlessly handles complex networks, automatically falling back to IP-based connection if local hostnames fail.

## 🚀 Get Started in 3 Steps (Seriously, It's This Easy!)

### Step 1: Flash the Firmware
Upload the firmware right from your web browser - no coding required (details below in [Quick Start](#quick-start)).

### Step 2: Power On & Connect
Insert the card into your CPAP and power it on. On your phone or PC, connect to the WiFi network named **`CPAP-AutoSync`**.

### Step 3: Configure via Visual Wizard
A setup page should open automatically. Follow the wizard to enter your WiFi and destination details.

---

**That's it!** The device will save, restart, and begin uploading your data.

**💻 Web Dashboard:** Once running, access the dashboard at **`http://cpap.local`** to monitor uploads, view logs, and manage settings.

**No SD card reader needed. No complex setup. Just a simple visual wizard.**

## Quick Start

### 0. Initialize the SD card

Insert the SD card in your CPAP machine and allow for the CPAP machine to format it.

### 1. Upload Firmware

**Important:** Connect the SD WIFI PRO to the development board with switches set to:
- Switch 1: OFF
- Switch 2: ON

**Browser-based web flasher:**

Use a **desktop Chromium-based browser** (Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Opera). *Safari and Firefox are not supported.*

1. Extract this release ZIP to a folder on your computer.
2. Open `https://esptool.spacehuhn.com/` in Chrome, Edge, or Opera.
3. Connect the ESP32 board by USB.
4. Click **Connect** and choose the serial port for the board.
   - *If you are not sure which port is correct, click Connect first, then plug in the board. The new port that appears is usually the right one.*
5. Delete any existing rows if needed, then click **Add** once.
6. Make sure the address is **`0x0`**.
7. Select **`firmware-ota.bin`**.
8. Click **Erase**.
9. Click **Program**.

> **Issues flashing or finding the port?** See [Advanced Flashing & Troubleshooting](../dev/advanced-flashing.md).

### 2. Visual Configuration (Recommended)

**No SD card reader is required for configuration.**

1. Insert the card into your CPAP machine and power it on.
2. On your smartphone or computer, search for the WiFi network named **`CPAP-AutoSync`** and connect to it.
3. A setup page should automatically open (Captive Portal). If it does not, open your browser and go to **`http://192.168.4.1`**.
4. Follow the visual wizard to enter your WiFi and upload details.
5. Click **Save and Restart**.

### 3. Power On & Dashboard

After configuring, the device will restart and connect to your home WiFi. It will then automatically:
1. Connect to WiFi
2. Sync time with internet
3. Wait for upload eligibility based on your schedule
4. Upload new files to your network share or SleepHQ

**Dashboard Access:** Open **[http://cpap.local](http://cpap.local)** in your browser to view progress and logs.

> [!NOTE]
> **Manual Configuration:** If you prefer to manually edit files rather than using the wizard, see the [Advanced Manual Configuration](../dev/manual-configuration.md) guide.

## Web Dashboard Features

The firmware includes a simple web interface accessible at **`http://cpap.local`** (or via its IP address).

- **Live Dashboard**: See real-time upload progress, active schedules, and overall system status.
- **Logs**: View what the device is currently doing or download past logs to diagnose issues.
- **Configuration Editor**: Need to change a password or adjust your upload schedule? You can edit your settings directly from your browser without removing the SD card from the CPAP.
- **SD Access Monitor**: Check if your CPAP machine is currently actively writing to the SD card.
- **Wireless Updates (OTA)**: Upload new firmware updates directly through the browser.

## Simplified Troubleshooting

### ⚠️ ESP32 Power Issues (Random Reboots)

If your device randomly reboots (shows "REBOOTING" constantly) or drops WiFi, it is likely experiencing a power dip. The CPAP machine's SD card slot provides limited power.

**Fix:** Move your WiFi router closer (or use a WiFi extender/mesh node). The device automatically reduces its transmission power by default to save energy. If it struggles to reach the router, it will fail to connect.

> *For deeper power troubleshooting steps, see the [Advanced Configuration](../dev/manual-configuration.md) guide.*

### ⚠️ SD Card Errors — Use Scheduled Mode

> **If your CPAP machine is showing "SD Card Error" or "SD Card Removed" messages, switch to `UPLOAD_MODE = scheduled` immediately.**

The default `smart` upload mode detects SD bus activity to decide when it is safe to take the card. On some CPAP models, this activity detection may not work perfectly, causing the uploader to take the SD card at the wrong moment.

**Fix:** Use the web dashboard (or setup wizard) to change your mode from **Smart** to **Scheduled**. In Scheduled mode, the uploader **only runs during the specific hours you set** (e.g. 9 AM–11 PM) and completely avoids checking the card while you sleep.

### WiFi Connection Issues
- **Device doesn't connect to WiFi:** Ensure your WiFi is 2.4GHz (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz). Try moving the router closer.
- **Cloud Upload Failed:** You are likely using your SleepHQ account password instead of an API Key. Generate an API key from the **Account Settings -> API Keys** section on the SleepHQ dashboard (requires Pro subscription).
