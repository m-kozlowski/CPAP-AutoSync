## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT COMPATIBILITY NOTICE**

### **Power Compatibility & Known Hardware Limits**

> [!NOTE]
> ℹ️ **AirSense 10 units:** These machines power-cycle the SD card slot every 60 seconds while actively blowing air. This causes the ESP32 card to constantly reboot during therapy, which will degrade the Web UI experience while you are sleeping. However, **this does not affect functionality** — once you stop therapy (take off the mask or stop the machine from blowing air), the card will boot up normally and complete the upload as expected.

> [!CAUTION]
> ⚠️ **AirSense 11** ***(🔍 ONLY REF 39517, check back sticker! 🏷️)*** ➔ Most **REF 39517** units have severe power limitations on their SD card slot. If the ESP32 card does not receive enough power, it will continually reset. You may experience frequent WiFi disconnects, failed uploads, or an "**SD Card Error**" on your CPAP machine's screen.

> 💡 **TIP: Hardware Modification Work in Progress**
> 
> One of our users is currently testing an **SD Card Extender mod** to add more capacitance to the power line. Initial tests show promising results (improving the R390-447/1 REF 39517 from 35% to 65% success rate). We are waiting for further testing with increased capacitance, which may fully resolve power issues for the problematic models. Investigations are also ongoing to see if a capacitor mod (or a newer AirSense firmware) might resolve the mid-therapy reboot issue on AirSense 10 units.

<summary><b>🔍 How to tell if your CPAP has power issues</b></summary>

> **⚠️ Identifying Power Issues**
>
> If your CPAP cannot provide enough power to the SD card, the ESP32 chip will reset itself. You might notice:
> - The device disappears from WiFi frequently
> - Uploads fail midway or never start
> - The web interface is unreliable
>
> You can confirm this is happening by looking at your logs:
> 1. If `PERSISTENT_LOGS=true` is set, check the downloaded logs from the web interface.
> 2. If the device cannot even stay online long enough to broadcast WiFi, pull the SD card and look for a file called `uploader_error.txt`.
>
> Look for this specific warning:
> ```text
> [INFO] Reset reason: Brown-out reset (low voltage)
> [ERROR] WARNING: System reset due to brown-out (insufficient power supply), this could be caused by:
> [ERROR]  - the CPAP was disconnected from the power supply
> [ERROR]  - the card was removed
> [ERROR]  - the CPAP machine cannot provide enough power
> ```

> **Versions between v0.11.0 and v3.0i:** Added progressively more aggressive power optimizations (reduced TX power, 802.11b disabled, Bluetooth disabled, CPU throttled, WiFi modem-sleep enabled) specifically to improve AirSense 11 compatibility, which allowed some previously incompatible models to work. Firmware configurations like `BROWNOUT_DETECT=OFF` can also help on borderline machines.

## 🚀 Quick Start — 4 Steps

### 1. Get the hardware
[SD WIFI PRO](https://www.fysetc.com/products/fysetc-upgrade-sd-wifi-pro-with-card-reader-module-run-wireless-by-esp32-chip-web-server-reader-uploader-3d-printer-parts) — an ESP32-powered SD card that physically inserts into your CPAP's SD card slot like a regular memory card.

### 2. Flash the firmware
👉 **[Download Latest Release](../../releases)** — the preferred first-time flashing method is the browser-based web flasher in Chrome, Edge, or Opera. The release package also includes fallback scripts for Windows, Mac, and Linux if needed.

Open the release ZIP and follow the **Firmware Upload** steps in the included guide:
**[Full Setup Guide](release/README.md)**

### 3. Create `config.txt` on the SD card
Just WiFi credentials and upload destination — **6 to 10 lines total**.

**👇 Click your upload destination:**

<details>
<summary><b>📤 Network Share (SMB — Windows, NAS, Samba)</b></summary>

```ini
WIFI_SSID = YourWiFiName
WIFI_PASSWORD = YourWiFiPassword
ENDPOINT_TYPE = SMB
ENDPOINT = //192.168.1.100/cpap_backups
ENDPOINT_USER = username
ENDPOINT_PASSWORD = password
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>☁️ SleepHQ Cloud</b></summary>

*(Note: A SleepHQ Pro subscription is required. The API keys below are generated from your SleepHQ Account Settings, they are **NOT** your username and password).*

```ini
WIFI_SSID = YourWiFiName
WIFI_PASSWORD = YourWiFiPassword

ENDPOINT_TYPE = CLOUD
CLOUD_CLIENT_ID = your-sleephq-client-id
CLOUD_CLIENT_SECRET = your-sleephq-client-secret
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔄 Both (SMB + SleepHQ simultaneously)</b></summary>

*(Note: A SleepHQ Pro subscription is required. The API keys below are generated from your SleepHQ Account Settings, they are **NOT** your username and password).*

```ini
WIFI_SSID = YourWiFiName
WIFI_PASSWORD = YourWiFiPassword
ENDPOINT_TYPE = SMB,CLOUD
ENDPOINT = //192.168.1.100/cpap_backups
ENDPOINT_USER = username
ENDPOINT_PASSWORD = password
CLOUD_CLIENT_ID = your-client-id
CLOUD_CLIENT_SECRET = your-client-secret
```
</details>

### 4. Insert card and open `http://cpap.local`

That's it. The device connects to WiFi, waits for your therapy session to end, and uploads automatically.

Open **[http://cpap.local](http://cpap.local)** in your browser to see live upload status, view logs, and manage settings. *(Note: `cpap.local` only resolves for the first 60 seconds after boot to save power — accessing it within this window redirects you to the device's IP address.)*

> **From here on, you can edit your config directly in the browser** — Config tab → Edit. No need to pull the SD card again.

---

## 🚨 Seeing an SD Card Error on your CPAP?

SD card errors typically happen for two reasons:
1. **Power Limits:** The CPAP machine cannot provide enough peak current to the SD slot during WiFi uploads. (Ensure you are running the latest firmware, which includes aggressive power-saving features).
2. **Bad Timing (Collisions):** In **smart** mode, uploads begin shortly after therapy ends. If you briefly pause therapy and then resume it while an upload is actively running, the CPAP and the WiFi SD card will clash over SD access.

If bad timing is causing your errors, you can avoid it entirely by switching to **scheduled** mode in `config.txt`, setting a window during your waking hours:

```ini
UPLOAD_MODE = scheduled
UPLOAD_START_HOUR = 9
UPLOAD_END_HOUR = 21
```

See the [Full Setup Guide](release/README.md#️-sd-card-errors--use-scheduled-mode) for details.

## CPAP Compatibility

| Feature | AirSense 10 (AS10) | AirSense 11 (AS11) |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Upload mode: Smart | ❌ Not supported* | ✅ Supported |
| Upload mode: Scheduled | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported |
| Stealth config read | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| SD bus mode | 1-bit (no DAT3) | 4-bit (DAT3 active) |

*AS10 uses 1-bit SD communication. The ESP32 cannot detect CPAP SD bus activity on DAT3, which Smart mode requires for automatic upload triggering. If `UPLOAD_MODE=smart` is set, the firmware automatically falls back to scheduled mode on AS10 units.

---

## What You Get

- **Automatic uploads after every therapy session** — smart mode detects when your CPAP finishes and starts uploading within minutes
- **Uploads to Windows shares, NAS, or SleepHQ** — or both at the same time
- **Web dashboard at `http://cpap.local`** — live progress, logs, config editor, OTA updates *(available for first 60 seconds after boot, then use IP address)*
- **Edit config from the browser** — no SD card pulls after initial setup
- **Never uploads the same file twice** — tracks what's been sent, even across reboots
- **Persistent log storage** — enable `PERSISTENT_LOGS=true` to flush logs to internal flash every 30 seconds; download past sessions from the browser. Emergency logs are always saved to SD card on boot failures and to internal flash before every reboot.
- **Live system diagnostics** — System tab tracks free heap, max contiguous allocation (with rolling 2-minute minimums), and CPU load graphs for both cores
- **Intelligent SD polling** — suppresses retries when perfectly synced, waiting in deep sleep until it detects you physically turning on your CPAP machine before it begins counting down to your next upload. Respects your CPAP machine entirely.

## Technical Note: Dual Stealth Mode Approaches

The firmware implements two distinct stealth mode approaches for SD card access:

1. **Boot Config Reading (AS10 only)**: `StealthConfigReader::readConfigTxt()` reads `config.txt` without any SD card initialization (no CMD0). Uses custom FAT32 parser. Returns card to original state found. Used only on AS10 at boot when PCNT detection indicates AS10 hardware.

2. **Upload State Preservation (AS10 and AS11)**: `captureCardState()`/`restoreToSavedState()` captures card state before `SD_MMC.begin()` (which sends CMD0) and restores it after `SD_MMC.end()`. No FAT32 parsing needed. Used on both AS10 and AS11 during upload cycles to preserve exact card state.

These approaches are orthogonal - config reading avoids SD_MMC entirely, upload preservation works around SD_MMC.

## Acknowledgements

This project was originally inspired by and started as a fork of the excellent [CPAP Data Uploader](https://github.com/amanuense/CPAP_data_uploader) project by Oscar Arias (amanuense). The initial goal of the fork was simply to add SleepHQ support, but it quickly grew into a fully distinct project with its own architecture, web dashboard, smart power management, and upload engine. We are deeply grateful to Oscar for proving the viability of the FYSETC SD WIFI PRO hardware and for creating the foundation that made this project possible.
