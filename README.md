<summary><b>🔍 How to tell if your CPAP has power issues</b></summary>

> **⚠️ Identifying Power Issues**
>
> If your CPAP cannot provide enough power to the SD card, the ESP32 chip will reset itself. You might notice:
> - The device disappears from WiFi frequently
> - Uploads fail midway or never start
> - The web interface is unreliable
>
> You can confirm this is happening by looking at your logs:
> 1. If `PERSISTENT_LOGS=true` is set, check the downloaded logs from the web interface.
> 2. If the device cannot even stay online long enough to broadcast WiFi, pull the SD card and look for a file called `uploader_error.txt`.
>
> Look for this specific warning:
> ```text
> [INFO] Reset reason: Brown-out reset (low voltage)
> [ERROR] WARNING: System reset due to brown-out (insufficient power supply), this could be caused by:
> [ERROR]  - the CPAP was disconnected from the power supply
> [ERROR]  - the card was removed
> [ERROR]  - the CPAP machine cannot provide enough power
> ```

> **Versions between v0.11.0 and v3.0i:** Added progressively more aggressive power optimizations (reduced TX power, 802.11b disabled, Bluetooth disabled, CPU throttled, WiFi modem-sleep enabled) specifically to improve AirSense 11 compatibility, which allowed some previously incompatible models to work. Firmware configurations like `BROWNOUT_DETECT=OFF` can also help on borderline machines.

## 🚀 Quick Start — 4 Steps

### 1. Get the hardware
[SD WIFI PRO](https://www.fysetc.com/products/fysetc-upgrade-sd-wifi-pro-with-card-reader-module-run-wireless-by-esp32-chip-web-server-reader-uploader-3d-printer-parts) — an ESP32-powered SD card that physically inserts into your CPAP's SD card slot like a regular memory card.

### 2. Flash the firmware
👉 **[Download Latest Release](../../releases)** — the preferred first-time flashing method is the browser-based web flasher in Chrome, Edge, or Opera. The release package also includes fallback scripts for Windows, Mac, and Linux if needed.

Open the release ZIP and follow the **Firmware Upload** steps in the included guide:
**[Full Setup Guide](docs/user/getting-started.md)**

### 3. Setup via Web Wizard (Recommended)
**No SD card reader? No problem.** You can now configure everything from your phone or computer without editing any files.

1. **Power On:** Insert the card into your CPAP and power it on.
2. **Connect:** On your phone or PC, look for a WiFi network named **`CPAP-Setup`** and connect to it.
3. **Configure:** A setup page should open automatically. If it doesn't, navigate to **`http://192.168.4.1`**.
4. **Follow the Wizard:** Enter your home WiFi details and your upload destination (SMB or SleepHQ).

The device will save your settings, restart, and automatically connect to your home network.

> [!TIP]
> **Manual `config.txt` still works:** If you prefer the old way, you can still create a `config.txt` file manually. See the [Advanced Configuration Guide](docs/user/configuration-ui.md) for details.

### 4. Open `http://cpap.local`

That's it. The device connects to WiFi, waits for your therapy session to end, and uploads automatically.

Open **[http://cpap.local](http://cpap.local)** in your browser to see live upload status, view logs, and manage settings. *(Note: `cpap.local` only resolves for the first 60 seconds after boot to save power — accessing it within this window redirects you to the device's IP address.)*

> **From here on, you can edit your config directly in the browser** — Config tab → Edit. 
> 
> **Note on Security:** For your protection, credentials are migrated to the device's secure flash memory (NVS) by default. After the first successful setup, you will see your passwords replaced with `***STORED_IN_FLASH***` in the configuration editor and the `config.txt` file. This is normal and expected.

## 🚨 Seeing an SD Card Error on your CPAP?

SD card errors typically happen for two reasons:
1. **Power Limits:** The CPAP machine cannot provide enough peak current to the SD slot during WiFi uploads. (Ensure you are running the latest firmware, which includes aggressive power-saving features).
2. **Bad Timing (Collisions):** In **smart** mode, uploads begin shortly after therapy ends. If you briefly pause therapy and then resume it while an upload is actively running, the CPAP and the WiFi SD card will clash over SD access.

If bad timing is causing your errors, you can avoid it entirely by switching to **scheduled** mode in `config.txt`, setting a window during your waking hours:

```ini
UPLOAD_MODE = scheduled
UPLOAD_START_HOUR = 9
UPLOAD_END_HOUR = 21
```

See the [Full Setup Guide](docs/user/getting-started.md#️-sd-card-errors--use-scheduled-mode) for details.

## CPAP Compatibility

| Feature | AirSense 10 (AS10) | AirSense 11 (AS11) |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Upload mode: Smart | ❌ Automatically falls back | ✅ Supported |
| Upload mode: Scheduled | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported |
| Stealth SD Card Access | ✅ Unified Capture/Restore | ✅ Unified Capture/Restore |
| SD bus mode | 1-bit (no DAT3) | 4-bit (DAT3 active) |

*AS10 uses 1-bit SD communication. The ESP32 cannot detect CPAP SD bus activity on DAT3, which Smart mode requires for automatic upload triggering. If `UPLOAD_MODE=smart` is set, the firmware automatically detects the hardware limitations and seamlessly falls back to scheduled mode on AS10 units.*

---

## What You Get

- **Automatic uploads after every therapy session** — smart mode detects when your CPAP finishes and starts uploading within minutes
- **Uploads to Windows shares, NAS, or SleepHQ** — or both at the same time
- **Zero-Touch Configuration Validation** — the visual setup wizard prevents you from saving configurations that could crash your CPAP's SD access
- **Automatic Device Discovery** — accesses the setup page natively, and automatically falls back to IP-based connection if your router or VPN blocks `cpap.local`
- **Web dashboard at `http://cpap.local`** — live progress, logs, config editor, OTA updates *(available for first 60 seconds after boot, then use IP address)*
- **Edit config from the browser** — no SD card pulls after initial setup
- **Never uploads the same file twice** — tracks what's been sent, even across reboots
- **Persistent log storage** — enable `PERSISTENT_LOGS=true` to flush logs to internal flash every 30 seconds; download past sessions from the browser. Emergency logs are always saved to SD card on boot failures and to internal flash before every reboot.
- **Live system diagnostics** — System tab tracks free heap, max contiguous allocation (with rolling 2-minute minimums), and CPU load graphs for both cores
- **Intelligent SD polling** — suppresses retries when perfectly synced, waiting in deep sleep until it detects you physically turning on your CPAP machine before it begins counting down to your next upload. Respects your CPAP machine entirely.

## Technical Note: Unified Stealth SD Card Access

The firmware implements a single, unified stealth mode approach for SD card access to ensure the CPAP machine is never disrupted:

1. **Capture**: Before `SD_MMC.begin()` is called (which sends CMD0), a stealth probe reads the card's RCA, current state, and bus width.
2. **Mount & Access**: The card is mounted and accessed normally.
3. **Restore**: After `SD_MMC.end()`, the card is restored to its exact pre-mount state (RCA, bus width, selected/deselected).

This ensures the CPAP machine resumes seamlessly without noticing the interruption.

*(Historical Note: Earlier versions used a custom FAT32 parser specifically for AS10 boot-time config reads. This has been retired in favor of the safer, unified capture/restore approach for all devices).*

## Acknowledgements

This project was originally inspired by and started as a fork of the excellent [CPAP Data Uploader](https://github.com/amanuense/CPAP_data_uploader) project by Oscar Arias (amanuense). The initial goal of the fork was simply to add SleepHQ support, but it quickly grew into a fully distinct project with its own architecture, web dashboard, smart power management, and upload engine. We are deeply grateful to Oscar for proving the viability of the FYSETC SD WIFI PRO hardware and for creating the foundation that made this project possible.
